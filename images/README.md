# Source Images

This directory is for the source images you want to animate.

## Instructions

1.  Place all your `.png` image files in this folder.
2.  Ensure the filenames contain numbers so they can be sorted correctly into the animation sequence.

**Example Naming Convention:**
- `image-1.png`
- `image-2.png`
- `image-3.png`
- ...and so on.

The script in the parent directory (`app.py`) will automatically find, sort, and process these images.
